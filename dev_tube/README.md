<h1> Distinctiveness and Complexity </h1>
In this project I created a program that uploads videos together with thumbnails, similar to uploading videos from youtube.
Also on this site I created an anonymous video comments system to make the site more dynamic.

I also created a video recommendation algorithm and views and likes system. And also to make the site more intuitive for the user, I made a search system that accesses my video models and shows the search results


Also in this project I integrated some external libraries like django-allauth, django-crispy-forms, django-filter, djangorestframework.

each of these bookstores helped me to make the video platform more scalable and stable and also to use the features they offer, for example django-allauth I used to develop a login and registration system, django-cripy forms I used to help django-allauth to customize the forms in this library. and django rest I used to make the site's api

Also in this project I performed tests following the steps of the last classes of the course, and applied delivery and development techniques such as kanbam and scrum.

I also made my platform scalable using ci/cd

I used the django framework throughout the project and I used javascript libraries in my website's video player.

<h1> additional information </h1>


and to make the login and registration system I used the django-allauth app

https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html

and to make the forms I used crispy forms and django_crispy_bulma which uses famework bulma.io to create the forms

<h1> how to use the web app? </h1>

first download the project dependencies , to do this you run the following code in your terminal

**`pip install -r requirements.txt`**

so then do a migrate as a precaution,
with the following code

**`python manage.py makemigrations`**

and then

**`python manage.py migrate`**

and now you can run the app by typing the following command in the terminal

**`python manage.py runserver`**

and a local host with port 8000 will appear, just click and your browser will open the website
